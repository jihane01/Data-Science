## Feature scaling (min-max)
Feature scaling is a preprocessing step in machine learning that aims to normalize the range of features or variables in your dataset. It is important because many machine learning algorithms assume that all features have the same scale. If the features have different scales, it can lead to biased or incorrect predictions.

One common technique for feature scaling is Min-Max scaling, which is also known as normalization. The MinMaxScaler is a popular implementation of this technique. It transforms the features by scaling them to a specified range, typically between 0 and 1. Here's how it works:

Identify the range of values for each feature in your dataset. Let's say the minimum value of a feature is min and the maximum value is max.

Subtract the minimum value (min) from each feature value. This step ensures that the minimum value becomes 0.

Divide the difference obtained in step 2 by the range (max - min). This step scales the feature values to the range between 0 and 1.

The formula for Min-Max scaling is:

scaled_value = (feature_value - min) / (max - min)

By applying the MinMaxScaler to your dataset, you can ensure that all the features have values within the same range. This is particularly useful when you have features with different units or scales. The scaled features are typically easier for machine learning algorithms to interpret and learn from.

Here's an example to illustrate how the MinMaxScaler works. Let's say you have a feature "Age" with values ranging from 20 to 60. After applying the MinMaxScaler, the values might be scaled to a range between 0 and 1, such as 0.0, 0.5, and 1.0. This scaling preserves the relative relationships between the values while making them more comparable.

Remember that when using the MinMaxScaler, you need to fit the scaler on your training data and then apply the same transformation to your testing or new data. This ensures that the scaling is consistent across the entire dataset.

### THE Summury Statistics
**MEAN**

we add the numbers and then we divide by the total of the number
Mean = Sum of all values / Number of values

For example, let's say we have the following set of numbers: 5, 8, 12, 4, 6. To find the mean, we add up all the numbers: 5 + 8 + 12 + 4 + 6 = 35. Since there are five numbers in the set, we divide the sum by 5: 35 / 5 = 7. Therefore, the mean of this dataset is 7.


**Mediane**

The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle number. If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. To find the median, you first arrange the values in order and then identify the middle number(s). For example, in the dataset: 5, 8, 12, 4, 6, the numbers arranged in ascending order would be: 4, 5, 6, 8, 12. Since there are five numbers in the set, the middle number is the third one, which is 6. Therefore, the median of this dataset is 6.

**MODE**
##
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. In other words, it is the number that occurs with the highest frequency. A dataset can have one mode, multiple modes (if multiple numbers appear with the same highest frequency), or no mode at all if all numbers have the same frequency. For example, in the dataset: 3, 4, 2, 4, 1, 3, 4, the number 4 appears most frequently (three times), so the mode of this dataset is 4.
